# What U Wanna Eat

## Description

This is a website where you can interact with a community of home chefs! Create a virtual cookbook with your own recipes, or go out and search for recipes of other chefs and make a cookbook of liked recipes. Admins can also peruse the best of the best recipes to feature them! These recipes are then displayed on the landing/login page and in a dedicated featured tab, and the chef that created the featured recipe will recieve a badge of honor for having their recipe featured on their recipe. In addition to viewing a recipe you can also request an email to send you the recipes ingredients list, so that you can shop and begin cooking it for yourself.
