# E-Commerce Back End API

## Description

This code is the backend to a potential E-Commerce website with models for categories, products, and tags. The API routes have been designed to get data from a SQL database for the respective models, create new data for a database via post methods, update data in a database via put methods, and delete data in a database via deletion methods. This code also has schema and seed files to help get you started with creating a database on your own computer via mysql. This code doesn't have a front-end designed for it so all your testing of it will need to be done via programs like insomnia. (To see the code in action please look at the video below. Also to use this application you will need to create a .env file if you are making a local server on your computer via mysql. This file does not appear in the repository as it was a part of the .gitignore file for the purpose of protecting my password for my mysql account. To set up your .env you just need to define the values needed for the connection.js file in the config folder.)
