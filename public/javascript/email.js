//pseudo code for some parts that can't exist without the api's being created:

//Grocery List formatter function
// A function that formats the grocery list ingredients into a single string variable,
//this string variable will then be passed into the email fetch function

//Email fetch function
// A Function that does a fetch request to most likely the user api where it can grab the users email
//The function above will also call and pass the email to the next function.

//Send email function

// Email.send({
//     SecureToken : "C973D7AD-F097-4B95-91F4-40ABC5567812", - this is generated by the website itself
//     To : 'them@website.com', - this will be the email from the email fetch function
//     From : "you@isp.com", - the gmail account that will be created for the website, so this is hardcoded
//     Subject : "Your Grocery List", - another hardcoded value 
//     Body : "And this is the body" - the body will be the grocery list created by the grocery list formatter function
// }).then(
//   message => alert(message)
// );
